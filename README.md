# Robot1

Robot1 is our platform for doing robot experiments.

Commands to the robot can be given via een BlueTooth to serial adapter and via Wi-Fi.

The Wi-Fi interface is done in a ESP32 Cam module, which has its own software.

Motor speed is measured with two encoder disks, mounted near the front wheels.

The robot is also equipped with four ultrasonic distance sensors, one on each side of the robot.
